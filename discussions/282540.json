    "Html": "<p>Hi Sudhanshu,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope you are doing great.&nbsp; Based on what you describe in your scenario you would probably need to trigger the initialization / creation of your response dependant UI from the OData.read() success handler function.&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll probably want to have some other piece of UI that shows up at the very beggining and letting the user know that your webapp is initializing, or loading while it is waiting for the response to come back.&nbsp; Then in the success handler you can hide or completely remove the \"Waiting\" UI element and show the real UI with all its glory :).</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Alex Trigo.</p>",
