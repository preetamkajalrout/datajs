I'm running datajs-1.1.1 and whatever comes out of the box in Visual Studio 2012 with WCF Data Services... and I just discovered that there are later versions of the WCF Data Services libraries available on nuget and that's probably why I'm seeing this error... However, I just installed the 5.6.0 libraries and I'm still getting the same error. Any idea of what's going on? Is there a config setting I'm missing?<br />\n",

Eventuall, I discovered that I needed to specify a datetime kind since it was serializing my datestamp as a local date with an offset. Doing the following inside my ChangeInterceptor solved the issue for me:<br />\n<pre><code>post.DateCreated = DateTime.SpecifyKind(DateTime.Now, DateTimeKind.Utc);</code></pre>\n\n",
