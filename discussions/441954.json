    "Html": "Hi Joe82,<br />\n<br />\nDatajs doesn't convert the EDM.Time to EDM.DateTime, it only converts it ms and store it in ms property.<br />\nThis is done because EDM.Time represents a time duration while EDM.DateTime represents a Date.<br />\nIf you convert the value to JavaScript date like for example <strong>new Date(milliseconds)</strong> the value won't be true because the JS date is milliseconds since 1970/01/01<br />\nwhile the EDM.Time value represents a duration.<br />\nhope this helps.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRegards,<br />\nHussein<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi Hussein,<br />\n<br />\nthe spec says:<br />\nEdm.Time<br />\nRepresents the time of day with values ranging from 0:00:00.x to 23:59:59.y, where x and y depend upon the precision<br />\n<pre><code>Example 1: 13:20:00\n</code></pre>\n\nSo for me this isn't a time duration but a time with a timezone. See also here:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#time</a><br />\n<br />\nAlso if you convert that value via new Date(milliseconds) the time should be always the same (depending on your timezone it might be different but with e.g. myDate.getUTCHours() you always get the same result as from the server...)<br />\n",
