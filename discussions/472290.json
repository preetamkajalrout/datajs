The maximum it will loop through is 6 times, but it may loop less, dependent on the situation.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy code looks like this:<br />\n<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; someArray.length; i++) {\n   var collection = someArray[i];\n                \n   OData.read({requestUri: collection.href, user: &quot;user&quot;, password:&quot;password&quot;},\n      function(data, response) {\n         var dataAsStr = JSON.stringify(data.results);\n         localStorage.setItem(collection.title, dataAsStr);\n      });\n   }\n            </code></pre>\n\nSo, I'm making a call, getting data back, and writing it out to localStorage. but I want to use the title of each collection, for the key used in localStorage. Problem is, the callback is asynchronous, so collection.title isn't valid when I get here. What I'd like to do is pass in a value into my read call, that would get returned to me in the success function. Can this be done?<br />\n",

In it, I use the productIndex in the callback that processes the data.
