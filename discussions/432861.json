So using SQL syntax I could do combinations like this: \r<br />\nSELECT * FROM <code>records</code> WHERE flags &amp; 1 AND flags &amp; 2 = 0 to get results where records are read and private. \r<br />\n<br />\nI looked through the OData documentation and I didn't find any way to work with bitmasks.  Is there any way to do that using OData syntax without creating custom functions on the server side?<br />\n",
