    "Html": "<p>Hi LukeGriffin,</p>\r\n<p>Does the same issue repro on desktop Internet Explorer or the Windows Phone 7 emulator? If it does you can attach Fiddler (take a look at <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fiddler/archive/2010/10/15/fiddler-and-the-windows-phone-emulator.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fiddler/archive/2010/10/15/fiddler-and-the-windows-phone-emulator.aspx</a>&nbsp;to see how to use Fiddler with the WP7 emulator) to debug the network traffic to see if that tells you anything. If the issue only repros on the physical device, you can still use the same settings with Fiddler, and then manually set the device to proxy through Fiddler.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, if you could send us a minimum repro of the issue we can take a look at it.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>David</p>",
