    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Dave,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume that you are doing a cross domain request using JSONP right?&nbsp;Unfortunately, with JSONP there is nothing you can do about setting headers and&nbsp;shaping the request in any other way than the url. This is because on how JSONP works and the fact that\r\n it relies on injecting &lt;script&gt; tags in the web page DOM to retrive the data. The only thing that can be changed on a &lt;script&gt; tag is the url it is pointing to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some blogs out there that explain some&nbsp;methods that would allow you to do an &quot;authenticated JSONP&quot; but they&nbsp;involve using&nbsp;magic tricks&nbsp;with IFrames and the like.&nbsp; My suggestion though is that you use a reverse proxy&nbsp;(a dummy service in the same\r\n domain as your webapp that&nbsp;just relays the request to the real endpoint in the other domain) or you might try to look into using CORS as well (disclaimer: CORS is still gaining traction and has to be supported by both&nbsp;the&nbsp;browser and the&nbsp;server.)</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Alex Trigo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
