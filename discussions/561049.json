Lately I had to change the datajs file to make it running and it wasn't that hard, but not sure if all functions are okay with that. I think at least 5% of all CORS programmers would appreciate to take this rather than just cut out everyone with IE9(customers).\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance.\r<br />\nFossil<br />\n",
