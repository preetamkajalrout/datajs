For example how is an entry, a link, properties,... provided by datajs?</p>\r\n<p>Are there any differences between JSON and ATOM/XML responses? (I realized that some XML/ATom services provide metadata in their response and that is then also available in datajs).</p>\r\n<p>In which structure is the metadata provided? As I realized it is provided if available in the __metadata properties.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally it would be nice that if I read the metadata first and then make a request with handing over this metadata that in the response I can also see the metadata. This is currently only the case if the server provides metadata in the ATOM/XML response\r\n document which is optional and not every server does this. Especially when using JSON there is no metadata included in the datajs response object also if I handed over the metadata in the request myself.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n",
