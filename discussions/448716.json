If yes how do I do it?\r<br />\n<br />\nNormally I would hand over the metadata handler but when using batch I use the batch handler.\r<br />\n<br />\nDoes this work or is that not possible?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks and best regards\r<br />\nJoe<br />\n",

But you are right, normally it is not necessary. \r<br />\n<br />\nI thought about doing the metadata batch request and additionally in that request do a loading of data where datajs can already use that returned metadata for the next data load request in the batch response from the server. But I guess this is not possible.<br />\n",
