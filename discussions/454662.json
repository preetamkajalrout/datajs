Is this by design? Is there any way to turn this off? I just want the data in its original form from the service, with metadata applied. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding how datajs is implemented.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,<br />\n<br />\nDataJS uses json verbose as the internal format for the final output object, so that if you request jsonlight, json verbose or atom, you will get the same result.<br />\nThe benefit you get from using json light with datajs is that the amount of data on the wire is smaller.<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately you can't skip the conversion to json verbose now, unless you create your own json handler and use it instead of the build in handler.<br />\n<br />\nWe are considering converting this internal format to json light with full metadata instead which would make sense, but this can be in a later release.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRegards,<br />\nHussein<br />\n",
