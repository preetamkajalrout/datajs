Doing all of this on my local machine, btw.\r<br />\n<br />\nFrom there, I open the sample.htm link in Chrome, and the page opens OK. But when I hit the &quot;Search&quot; button, the call to Odata.read fails. I get a 400 - Bad Request back.\r<br />\n<br />\nApparently it has something to do with the &quot;enableJsonpCallback&quot; flag being set to true.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm extremely new to this kind of development. I'm just trying to understand datajs by going through the samples. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />\n",
