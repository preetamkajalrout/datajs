<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Overview</h1>datajs is a cross-browser JavaScript library that supports data-centric web applications by leveraging modern protocols and browser features. It&#39;s designed to be small, fast, and provide functionality that makes web applications first-class citizens of web data.<br /><br />Currently the library offers functionality to communicate with <a href="http://www.odata.org/">OData</a> services, leverage storage mechanisms in the browsers such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">IndexedDB</a>, and provides a convenient API for efficiently caching lists of data by combining remote services with local storage.<br /><br />The OData support includes receiving data and submitting changes or invoking service operations. The API can be made aware of metadata in cases where it&#39;s required, and operations can be batched to minimize round-trips. If you&#39;re not familiar with OData, there are good resources for learning at <a href="http://www.odata.org/developers">http://www.odata.org/developers</a>.
