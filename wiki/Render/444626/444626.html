<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Master-Detail Sample</h1>
This sample builds on the <a href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Local%20Service%20Sample&referringTitle=Master-Detail%20Sample">Local Service Sample</a> and adds a page that can be used to add and remove comments from ideas in the idea service. In a typical master-detail scenario, a primary list is displayed (the &quot;master&quot; list), and as selection changes on this master list, another (the &quot;details&quot; list) is updated to display associated information.<br /><br />Some techniques demonstrated include:<br />
<ul><li>How to load items from a collection on demand instead of eagerly and manage the collection locally.</li>
<li>Using <a href="http://www.knockout.com/">Knockout</a> to simplify data binding and tracking selection. </li></ul>
<br />A more advanced scenario where both master and detail elements can be further edited can be built by combining with techniques from the <a href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Simple%20CRUD%20Sample&referringTitle=Master-Detail%20Sample">Simple CRUD Sample</a>.<br /><br />The sample file is <a href=".\d01dabd0-85ef-4059-a6aa-381ce926c68b">ideamd.htm</a>, which can be added to the <a href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Local%20Service%20Sample&referringTitle=Master-Detail%20Sample">Local Service Sample</a> to run.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
