<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Storing Preferences Sample</h1>
This sample demonstrates the use of the datajs Store API to store preferences for a web application.<br /><br />datajs provides support for storing data in the browser such that itâ€™s available even if the browser is restarted. The stores are used as key/value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is a Javascript value persisted through a JSON round-trip. In this sample, the store is used to persist color preferences for a web application.<br /><br />This sample demonstrates:
<ul><li>Creating a new store and opening an existing store </li>
<li>Reading values from the store and handling error conditions </li>
<li>Writing values to the store </li></ul>
<br />The sample file is <a href=".\f7b69dc0-c5d7-4d18-a8d4-6399f5d82998">store.htm</a>.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> The Store API does not work through file://, so the sample will not run if the HTML file is opened directly from the browser. Add the file to the <a href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Local%20Service%20Sample&referringTitle=Storing%20Preferences%20Sample">Local Service Sample</a> project and run it from there.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
