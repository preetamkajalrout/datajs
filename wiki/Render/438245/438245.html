<div class="wikidoc"><h1>OData Networking</h1>
The OData functionality in datajs is based on an <span class="codeInline">httpClient</span> object. The responsibility of the object is to implement an asynchronous network request through a <span class="codeInline">request</span> API.<br /><br />By default, datajs will use the XMLHttpRequest object in the browser to make a network request. If JSONP is enabled, it will use this technique when the request is for a different domain.<br /><br />You can use a different <span class="codeInline">httpClient</span> object by setting it on the appropriate API call or, in the case of the cache, by setting the <span class="codeInline">httpClient</span> property on the constructor options.<br /><br />The default client is available through <span class="codeInline">OData.defaultHttpClient</span>, which is used when the caller doesn&#39;t specify one explicitly. You can use this directly as well, for example to implement a custom <span class="codeInline">httpClient</span> that modifies the request and then calls the original behavior. See <a href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Custom%20OData%20httpClient&referringTitle=OData%20Networking">Custom OData httpClient</a> for a sample.<br /><br />Because the implementation is based on XMLHttpRequest, some of its constraints are also applicable to datajs. For example:
<ul><li>Some headers are restricted and cannot be set, for example <span class="codeInline">Referer</span>.</li>
<li>Redirections from the server have limited support. In some formats, relative URLs may be corrupted; in some browsers, the second request may change the headers - in particular, addressing the root of a service <span class="codeInline">http://server/service</span> may redirect to <span class="codeInline">http://server/service/</span> and cause the request to fail.</li>
