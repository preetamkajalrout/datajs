<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Using Stores</h1>
datajs provides support for storing data in the browser such that it&#39;s available if the network connectivity is lost or if the browser is restarted.<br /><br />There are three mechanisms currently supported:<br />
<ol><li>Local Storage, often referred to as DOM storage.</li>
<li>IndexedDB, currently in experimental support.</li>
<li>In-memory storage, useful as a fallback mechanism for browsers that don&#39;t support any of the newer APIs.</li></ol>
<br />These stores can be used as key/value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is a JavaScript value persisted through a JSON round-trip. The APIs are asynchronous, and so code written for one store should work the same across all stores.<br /><br />See also the <a href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=datajs%20store%20API&referringTitle=Using%20Stores">datajs store API</a> reference.
