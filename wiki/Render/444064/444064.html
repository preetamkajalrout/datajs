<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Linked Data Sample</h1>
This sample builds on the <a href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Local%20Service%20Sample&referringTitle=Linked%20Data%20Sample">Local Service Sample</a> and adds a page that can be used to categorize ideas from the idea service.<br /><br />The relationship between ideas and categories is a typical many-to-many association. The user interface for these sort of relationships will typically vary depending on the number of elements on each side. In this case, the sample simply presents a collection of check boxes for each idea.<br /><br />Some techniques demonstrated include:<br />
<ul><li>How to craft a request that adds / removes a link or association from a collection.</li>
<li>Using <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> to simplify data binding, including binding check boxes to arrays.</li>
<li>Adding a view model observable property, communicating, useful to avoid submitting multiple requests to the server at the same time.</li></ul>
