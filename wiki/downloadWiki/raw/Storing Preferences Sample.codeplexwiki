! Storing Preferences Sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the datajs Store API to store preferences for a web application.

datajs provides support for storing data in the browser such that itâ€™s available even if the browser is restarted. The stores are used as key/value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is a Javascript value persisted through a JSON round-trip. In this sample, the store is used to persist color preferences for a web application.

This sample demonstrates:
* Creating a new store and opening an existing store 
* Reading values from the store and handling error conditions 
* Writing values to the store 

The sample file is [file:store.htm].

*Note:* The Store API does not work through file://, so the sample will not run if the HTML file is opened directly from the browser. Add the file to the [Local Service Sample] project and run it from there.
