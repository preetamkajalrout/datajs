# Overview

datajs is a cross-browser JavaScript library that supports data-centric web applications by leveraging modern protocols and browser features. It's designed to be small, fast, and provide functionality that makes web applications first-class citizens of web data.

Currently the library offers functionality to communicate with [OData](http://www.odata.org/) services, leverage storage mechanisms in the browsers such as [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/), and provides a convenient API for efficiently caching lists of data by combining remote services with local storage.

## The OData support includes receiving data and submitting changes or invoking service operations. The API can be made aware of metadata in cases where it's required, and operations can be batched to minimize round-trips. If you're not familiar with OData, there are good resources for learning at [http://www.odata.org/developers](http://www.odata.org/developers).
