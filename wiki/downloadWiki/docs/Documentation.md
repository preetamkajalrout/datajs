# Welcome to datajs

Welcome to the datajs library project! The documentation on this site should help you [Getting Started](./Getting%20Started.md) quickly and provide you an [Overview](./Overview.md) of the functionality you can gain by using this library, as well as detailed [References](./References.md) on everything that's available.

If you have feedback or questions, we'd like to encourage you get in touch with the community through the [Discussions](http://datajs.codeplex.com/discussions) section of the site.
