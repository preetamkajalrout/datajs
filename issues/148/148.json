    "Description": "Hi guys,\nÂ \nI don't know if this is a server issue or a datajs issue. Please see the attached screenshot first. I used datajs v.0.0.2 and IE8.\nThe server responded with the response header \"content-type\" but datajs checks for \"Content-Type\" (case sensitive) line 3527. So the header is not found and the handler function is not called.\nThe spec says: \nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2\nEach header field consists of a name followed by a colon (\":\") and the field value.\nField names are case-insensitive.\nSo after that a server may also respond with \"content-type\".\nCould you please check this?\nThanks!",

Did building work well for you? Is the code more or less well organized, or do you think we should invest time in improving some particular aspect?",
