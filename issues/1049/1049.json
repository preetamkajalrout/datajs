    "Description": "Hi I walked through the current 1.1.1beta and made some changes (mostly to make jsLint happy) && hope I did not break anything && it helps :-)\n\nFormat is diff -Nua i.e.:\n\n$ datajs-1.1.1beta.js atajs-1.1.1beta-sdrees.js > datajs-1.1.1beta_diff-Nua.txt \n\nbut I can also provide the changed complete file (if patch is not at hand).\n\nEDIT: Please ignore diff here. I submitted a patch with ID 14425 and sorry for not reading the top level menu thoroughly before (so I did not came across the patch submission entry before writing this issue here :-)\n\nAll the best,\nStefan.",
