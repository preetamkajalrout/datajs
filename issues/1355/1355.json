    "Description": "Hi guys,\n\nI found a little issue on OS X Safari, you can find the details including a solution about it here: http://www.nabisoft.com/tutorials/javascript/resolving-datajs-response-header-access-errors-for-safari-on-mac-os-x\n\n__To make it short:__ in line 2581 there is a missing call of __normalizeHeaders(headers);__\n\nThis leads to the fact that in OS X Safari you have to access the response header with __response.headers['Content-Type']__ while you have to use __response.headers['content-type']__ for other browsers. It seems that Safari changes standard HTTP headers, i.e. 'content-type' is changed to 'Content-Type' even though the server sends all lower-case headers (I guess this is for a better human readability).\n\nPlease also have a look at the learnings of my tutorial. I am not sure if it's a good approach to pass headers via arrays, however, I am sure there was a good reason for that...\n\nBest,\nNabi\n\nps Thanks for the great work on datajs!!!",
