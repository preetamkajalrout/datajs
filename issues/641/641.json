    "Description": "I am wondering if DataJS is suitable to be used on the server side in a node application?  The OData.org website suggests that it is (by implication): http://www.odata.org/libraries#node.js   \nÂ \nBut on the other hand, it also seems that the JSON parser depends on the window object.  Wouldn't that make it not usable by Node?",
