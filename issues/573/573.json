    "Description": "The construction of the DjsDeferred seems to be initializing the wrong state attributes for resolved and rejected in changeset 10870\n \nvar DjsDeferred = function() {\n \n        this._arguments = undefined;\n        this._done = undefined;\n        this._fail = undefined;\n        this.resolved = false; // shouldn't this be this._resolved = false;\n        this.rejected = false;  // shouldn't this be this._rejected = false;\n    };\n \nI base this on the coding inside the prototype.then function, where the \"state\" of this._resolved is checked and if truthy this.resolve.apply is executed.  The same thing is done for this._rejected if the prior test was falsey against the this.reject.apply.",
